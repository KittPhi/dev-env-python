# Challenge: Given a 2D array(m x n). The task is to check if 
# there is any path from top left to bottom right. In the matrix, 
# -1 is considered as blockage (canâ€™t go through this cell) and 
#  0 is considered path cell (can go through it).

row = 5
col = 5
# Python3 program to find if there is path from top left to right bottom  
def isPath(arr): 
	# set arr[0][0] = 1 
	arr[0][0] = 1

	# Mark reachable (from top left) 
	# nodes in first row and first column. 
	for i in range(1, row): 
		if (arr[i][0] != -1): 
			arr[i][0] = arr[i-1][0] 

	for j in range(1, col): 
		if (arr[0][j] != -1): 
			arr[0][j] = arr[0][j-1] 
			
	# Mark reachable nodes in 
	# remaining matrix. 
	for i in range(1, row): 
		for j in range(1, col): 
			if (arr[i][j] != -1): 
				arr[i][j] = max(arr[i][j - 1], 
								arr[i - 1][j]) 
								
	# return yes if right 
	# bottom index is 1 
	return (arr[row - 1][col - 1] == 1)
