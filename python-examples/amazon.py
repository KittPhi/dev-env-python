# efficiency and optimization, as opposed to brute force solutions

# Data Structures
# Storing and providing access to data in efficient ways.
# Know Runtimes and how they use memory

# Algorithms
# traversals and divide and conquer algorithms.

# Object-Oriented Design:
# Know the appropriate use of inheritance and aggregation
# - Aggregation: Manager has many workers under him, they don't belong to any other Manager.

# Databases
# How relational and non-relational databases work and what tradeoffs
# - Relational: a table relates to another table (SQL)
#   - Slower when Data gets larger because the tables are related (connected)
# - Non-Relational: a table is not related to any other table 
#   - Can hold more more data and access data faster

# Check for edge cases and validate that no bad input can slip through
