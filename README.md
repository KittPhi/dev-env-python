## Why Cython:
> Third-party libraries like NumPy, which wrap C libraries, can improve the performance of some operations significantly, 
but sometimes you just need the raw speed and power of C directly in Python.

> Cython was developed to make it easier to write C extensions for Python, and to allow existing Python code to be transformed into C

> Whatâ€™s more, Cython allows the optimized code to be shipped with a Python application without external dependencies.

Install cython
